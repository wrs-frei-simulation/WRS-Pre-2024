# World Robot Summit 2025 Harsh Environment F-REI Challenge, Simulation Disaster Challenge, 2024 Pre-tournament

Japanese Page（日本語ページ）: https://github.com/wrs-frei-simulation/WRS-Pre-2024/blob/main/Readme-ja.md

## Overview
The competition at the 2024 Pre-tournament was set up with the scenario of “Information gathering and emergency response in a harsh environment, assuming a plant disaster".
Under these settings, the simulation environment consisted of four areas, Area 1 to Area 4, as shown below.
The competition was divided into each area.

## Introduction to each area

### Area 1: Lever control, Turning on the light

![Area1](./fig/area1-en.png)

#### Scenario
The operator explores an area where objects are scattered after a plant disaster using robots by remote-control. 
As this area is dark, the robots can turn on lights to brighten the area by operating the switch.
In order to explore the area, you must read as many QR codes as possible, which are scattered around the area, and move the robot from the start area to the goal area within the time limit.
This area is constructed to measure the movement, manipulation and search abilities of the robots.
In addition, it is necessary to assume that the field of vision will be reduced due to the effects of communication in remote control, and that there may be sudden power outages.

- When the robot turns the switch up, the light comes on the area.

- You explore the entire area and search for the QR codes as possible. The QR codes are inside the tubes.

### Area 2: Valve manipulation

![Area2](./fig/area2-en.png)
	
#### Scenario
As in Area 1, you must explore an area where objects are scattered around after a plant disaster. Gases (smoke) and liquids (water) leak from pipes in the area, so the robot can stop the leaking fluids by operating the valves.
In order to explore the area, you must read as many QR codes as possible, which are scattered around the area, and move the robot from the start area to the goal area within the time limit.
This area is constructed to measure the movement, manipulation and search abilities of the robots.
In addition, it is necessary to assume that the field of vision will be reduced due to the effects of communication in remote control, and that there may be sudden power outages.

- By turning the valve, the robot can stop the leaking fluid (smoke, water, etc.).

### Area 3: Firefighting

![Area3](./fig/area3-en.png)

#### Scenario
You must explore this area where objects are scattered after a plant disaster. Since there is a fire in the area, the robots take out a fire hose from the fire extinguisher box and put out the fire.
In order to explore the area, you must read as many QR codes as possible, which are scattered around the area, and move the robot from the start area to the goal area within the time limit.
This area is constructed to measure the movement, manipulation and search abilities of the robots.
In addition, it is necessary to assume that the field of vision will be reduced due to the effects of communication in remote control, and that there may be sudden power outages.

- The robot takes out the fire hose from the fire extinguisher box and put out the fire.

### Area 4: Entering ducts, tank inspections

![Area4](./fig/area4-en.png)

#### Scenario
You use the robot, which is UAV, to enter the duct and investigate the tank connected to the duct. Airflow is generated from the duct, and the robot can stop the airflow by operating the valve.
In order to explore the area, you must read as many QR codes as possible, which are scattered around the area, and move the robot from the start area to the goal area within the time limit.
This area is constructed to measure the movement, manipulation and search abilities of the robots.
In addition, it is necessary to assume that the field of vision will be reduced due to the effects of communication in remote control, and that there may be sudden power outages.


- The UAV enters through the duct and inspects the inside of the tank. (If there is air flow, etc., the robot close the valve first.)

This github repository contains area models for Areas 1, 2, 3 and 4.
These areas can be used for practice. The difficulty level of these areas has been intentionally set low.
In addition, up to two robots can be deployed to carry out tasks in each area, and they can be made to work together.

Choreonoid is used as the robot simulator in the World Robot Summit 2025 Simulation Disaster Challenge.
Moreover, AGX Dynamics is used as a physics engine.

#### AGX Dynamics installation reference
- https://choreonoid.org/ja/documents/latest/agxdynamics/install/install-agx-ubuntu.html

#### How to install Choreonoid
- Requirements
	- OS: Ubuntu22.04，CPU: amd64 (Intel CPU, Ryzen CPU)
	- ROS2: Humble Hawksbill 
	- Cannot be installed on a virtual environment on an Apple Silicon Mac (because the CPU is arm-based)
- Building Choreonoid for the competitor's computer 
	1. Building Choreonoid Without ROS2 for the first time
	2. Rebuilding Choreonoid Without ROS2 For Pre-competition (Already Choreonoid built)
	3. Building Choreonoid for pre-tournament (with ROS2 integration)

#### 1. Building Choreonoid Without ROS2 for the first time
```bash
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/choreonoid/choreonoid.git
$ git clone https://github.com/wrs-frei-simulation/WRS-Pre-2024.git choreonoid/ext/WRS2024PRE
